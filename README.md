# Smoking Cessation on BMI Change
## Visual Data Presentation: 
Created tables and plots (density and bar charts) to visualize distributions of categorical variables by smoking cessation status.


## Regression Models: 
Built multiple regression models adjusting for various confounders (age, sex, education, etc.) to determine variable contributions.
## Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW): 
Applied propensity score methods to estimate causal effects while accounting for confounding.
## G-Formula with Bootstrap: 
Employed to calculate average causal effects and provide confidence intervals, ensuring robust statistical findings.

## Key Findings:
- Smoking cessation significantly impacts BMI change, with adjustment for key confounders.
- The study highlights the importance of controlling for demographic and clinical variables in public health research.
- Application of advanced analytical methods (IPW and G-formula) demonstrates causal understanding and robust estimation.
